# Overview

I decided to create this Web App to practice how to utilize Django with Python and be able to create a simple blog posting site.
To get this program running all you need to do is run python manage.py runserver in the terminal and click on the link that is provided.
Once there you can see the blogs made there and be able to add them there.

# Web Pages

The initial page that you go to is full of links that go to the individually made blog posts and when you click on the Add a Post button in the navigation bar it will send you to a page where you can make new posts and have them appear on the initial page.
